- make sure the store can be easily used outside of rails (e.g. try it out with sinatra)
- do some rake tasks to create the database tables and stuff when using active record outside of rails (e.g. with sinatra)
- make sure that requiring the active_record_openid_store outside or rails works properly
- add some specs
- fix up some of the code (after specs have been added)
